### URL-encodes string
Every server language has some type of the function, returning the string,in which all non-alphanumeric characters except -_. have been replaced with a percent (%) sign followed by two hex digits and spaces encoded as plus (+) signs. It is encoded the same way that the posted data from a web-form, that is the same way as in `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` media type. This differs from the Â» [RFC 3986] encoding (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3986) in that for historical reasons, spaces are encoded as plus (+) signs.

#### PHP
In PHP it is represented by [urlencode]function (http://php.net/manual/en/function.urlencode.php).
